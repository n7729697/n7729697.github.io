### Teaching Philosophy: Learning by Doing
I believe that students learn best through Project-Based Learning (PBL) and hands-on experiences, where they apply theoretical concepts to real-world challenges. This approach fosters active engagement, critical thinking, and the development of both technical and soft skills, such as teamwork and adaptability. By working on meaningful projects, students not only deepen their understanding but also gain valuable industry-relevant skills. I emphasize reflection and iterative improvement, guiding students to take ownership of their learning while providing constructive feedback. PBL also offers flexibility, accommodating diverse interests and learning styles, making it an inclusive and effective method for preparing students for academic and professional success.
