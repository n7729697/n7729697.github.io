To make the nested collapsable sections with proper indentation, the HTML tag `<details>` is need to create a collapsable sections, but the content inside should be written in HTML, and I do want to write the content in Markdown to make advantages of the ease of intentaion.

The HTML tag `<details>` should be also followed by `<summary>` tag to specify a visible heading for the details. If I nest a few `<details>`, how do I indent the whole section body? Where should I put my closing details tag on the closing line? `</details>` tag must be indented as if it was part of the "body" of the `<detail>` tag. After two hours researching, I found a way to solve it by following [this thread](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/77822788/nested-indented-lists-with-collapsable-sections).

## Solution to my page
The whole contents are not markdown anymore, it's "just" pure - yet valid - HTML. Each section can have it's own re-indented lists with collapsable items, and regular markdown content. The tricky part is how GitHub-flavored Markdown reacts to spaces and such. You have to indent your whole section in a specific way, and your closing `</details>` tag must be indented as if it were part of the body. 

This is how it looks like:
- <details open, markdown="1">
  <summary>Section 1</summary>

  - <details>
    <summary>subsection 1</summary>

    - a list
    - with some stuff

    > and other things

    - [x] like
    - [ ] a task list 

    </details>

  - <details>
    <summary><b>another subsection</b></summary>

    a. with another list
    b. and some other stuff
    d. [and](),
      [more](),
      [classic](),
      [md]
    e. _no need_ __of html__
    </details>

  - <details markdown="1">
    <summary>last sub-section</summary>

    blablabla

    ```rb
    def some_code
      puts "Rails is so cool"
    end
    ```
    </details>

  - a random not collapsable section
    > legacy. Should be restructured.

    ```js
    console.log("look what I found, a new js framework. Still no real alternative to rails though")
    ```

  - <details>
    <summary>and another collapsable section</summary>

    ...
  </details>

- <details markdown="1">
  <summary>section 2</summary>
      
  some parent content

  and another list

  - <details>
    <summary>section 2.1</summary>

      and some content
    </details>

  - <details>
    <summary>section 2.2</summary>

      and some content
    </details>
  
  - section 2.3
    and some no collapsed content

</details>
