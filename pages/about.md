# **About Me**
 
Hi I am NIU <span class="hover">Xuezhi<span class="tooltip">It pronounces like "**Sh**e+**ü**+b**e**d ju**dge**". **sju**e+**dj**ur+**yee** på svenska. </span></span> :wave:,<br>  牛雪芝

I am a first year Ph.D. student in Division of Computer Systems at Uppsala University [Cyber-physical Systems Lab](https://www.it.uu.se/research/group/CPS-Lab) and supervised by Dr. [Didem Gürdür Broo](https://www.uu.se/en/contact-and-organisation/staff?query=N22-649) and Dr. [Ginevra Castellano](https://www.uu.se/en/contact-and-organisation/staff?query=N14-947). My research interests lie in Robotics, Cyber-Physical Systems, Systems & Dynamics and Heterogeneous Robot Collaboration. My research focuses on multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) for heterogeneous multi-robot collaboration. I am particularly interested in developing methods that enable teams of robots with diverse capabilities to coordinate effectively in dynamic environments.

<!-- My work addresses challenges such as asymmetric information sharing, decentralized decision-making under uncertainty, and scalable learning architectures.

One of my central aims is to design algorithms that allow robots to adapt their behaviors based on both their own state and the states of others, improving collective performance without requiring centralized control. Current efforts include the exploration of symbiotic learning principles, where mutual benefit and adaptive role assignment are used to enhance team efficiency. Applications of my research include warehouse automation, search and rescue operations, and service robotics in semi-structured environments.

Methodologically, I integrate techniques from deep reinforcement learning, multi-agent systems, and cyber-physical system modeling. I also explore practical issues such as asynchronous reward assignment, energy-aware task planning, and robustness to agent failures. -->

<!-- As a Mechatronics graduate with a strong mechanical background. I have a strong background in designing and developing complex systems that integrate mechanical, electronic and software components. Experienced in interdisciplinary collaboration and leading teams to achieve project milestones. Proficient in C/C++, Matlab, Python. proficient in design and analysis using SolidWorks, AutoCAD, MATLAB, ROS and other software. Expertise in hardware development, 3D printing and PCB design. Fluent in English and Chinese.  -->
