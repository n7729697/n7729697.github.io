<h2 id="ethical-principles">Ethical Principles</h2>

<h3 id="lab-safety">Lab Safety</h3>

<p>Before we dive into the exciting world of robotics and cyber-physical systems, we must ensure that every lab member is equipped with the knowledge and respect for safety protocols that govern our operations. This commitment to maintaining a secure environment is not just about adhering to rules but about fostering a culture of mindfulness and responsibility towards oneself and others in the lab.</p>
<details>
  <summary>Under no circumstances should any robotic operation be manually interrupted by hand</summary>

  <p>Direct physical interaction with moving parts or operational machinery presents a significant risk of injury and can damage the equipment. If there is a need to halt a robot’s operation, the first course of action should always be an attempt to interrupt the process via command through the controlling software. If the software fails to respond or an immediate stop is necessary, the next step is to safely power off the equipment. Only after these measures are taken should new operations be initiated.</p>

</details>

<details>
  <summary>No unattended robotic operations</summary>

  <p>It is imperative that robotic operations are not left unattended. When actuating ideas on the robots, your presence is required at all times. This rule ensures that any unexpected issues can be addressed promptly and reduces the risk of accidents or damage to the lab equipment. Unattended operations increase the likelihood of unforeseen incidents, which can lead to potential harm to both the individual and the workspace.</p>

</details>

<details>
  <summary>Pre-Operation Inspection</summary>

  <p>Before initiating any experiment or operation with robotic systems, perform a thorough pre-operation inspection. This includes checking for any signs of wear and tear, ensuring all parts are secured and in their correct positions, and verifying that the software and hardware communication is functioning correctly. Regular inspections help prevent accidents caused by equipment malfunction or failure.</p>

</details>

<details>
  <summary>Shutdown Before Leaving</summary>

  <p>All robotic systems must be properly shut down before leaving the lab. This rule is crucial to prevent any accidental activation or continuation of operations that could occur in the absence of supervision. A powered-down state ensures that the equipment remains safe and secure until it is next used under direct supervision.</p>

</details>

<details>
  <summary>Also take care of robots</summary>

  <p>When working with robots, consider not only your safety but also the well-being of the robots. Abrupt shutdowns or erratic operational commands can lead to wear and tear or even permanent damage to sensitive components. Always shut down the robots gently and as per the recommended procedures when you are done or if you are leaving the lab, even for a short period. This practice extends the lifespan of the robots and maintains their readiness for future experiments.</p>

</details>

<h3 id="respect-for-privacy">Respect for Privacy</h3>
<details>
  <summary>Data Collection</summary>

  <p>Prior informed consent must be obtained explicitly detailing how the data will be used, stored, and eventually disposed of. Consent forms should comply with <a href="https://gdpr-info.eu/">GDPR</a> standards, clearly stating the purpose and scope of data collection. Provide participants with clear information about the data processing activities and their rights under <a href="https://gdpr-info.eu/">GDPR</a>, including the right to access, rectify, and erase their data.</p>

</details>

<details>
  <summary>Data Handling</summary>

  <p>Implement rigorous data anonymization and pseudonymization techniques to protect personal information. Ensure these techniques conform to <a href="https://gdpr-info.eu/">GDPR</a> requirements to prevent data re-identification. Adopt robust security measures to protect personal data against unauthorized or unlawful processing and against accidental loss, destruction, or damage. This includes encryption, access control, and regular security assessments.</p>

</details>

<details>
  <summary>Data Usage</summary>

  <p>Use collected data strictly within the terms agreed upon at the point of collection and in compliance with GDPR. This includes ensuring that data processing is lawful, fair, and transparent. Maintain records of processing activities to demonstrate compliance with <a href="https://gdpr-info.eu/">GDPR</a>. This includes documenting the legal basis for processing, data sharing, and retention practices.</p>

</details>

<h3 id="safety-and-security">Safety and Security</h3>
<details>
  <summary>Physical Safety</summary>

  <ul>
    <li>All personnel should complete comprehensive safety training specific to the lab environment, including emergency procedures, proper handling of equipment, and awareness of potential hazards. Record the incident details, including the time, cause, and personnel involved, once it happens.</li>
    <li>Maintain at least a 0.1-meter distance from operating robots unless performing specific tasks that require closer proximity. Clearly mark all exits, safety equipment like fire extinguishers and first aid kits, and provide easy access to emergency shutdown buttons for all critical equipment.</li>
    <li>Under no circumstances should any robotic operation be manually interrupted by hand. When actuating ideas on the robots, your presence is required at all times.</li>
  </ul>

</details>

<details>
  <summary>Cybersecurity</summary>

  <ul>
    <li>Ensure that all connections to robotic systems are made strictly through the lab’s secure network. External access should be disabled to prevent unauthorized control from outside networks.</li>
    <li>Always shut down robots completely before leaving the lab to prevent unauthorized access or manipulation. This includes turning off the robots’ power and disconnecting any network connections. Implement routine checks upon startup to ensure that no unauthorized modifications were made while systems were inactive. This can include verifying software checksums and conducting a quick operational test cycle.</li>
    <li>Firewalls should remain active at all times to protect against external threats and to manage data flow to and from the robots. Any deactivation of firewalls must be strictly controlled. Deactivation of firewalls is only permissible under the direct authorization of the lab manager for specific, controlled experiments where firewall activity might interfere with necessary communications. Immediately after the completion of experiments requiring firewall deactivation, the firewalls must be reactivated. This process should be documented, including the duration of deactivation, the reasons, and the person responsible for the operation.</li>
  </ul>

</details>

<details>
  <summary>Data Security</summary>

  <ul>
    <li>Use strong encryption protocols for storing and transmitting data, particularly data that is sensitive or proprietary.There are several encryption protocols that provide strong security measures. Some of these include SSL/TLS, AES, RSA, HotP, IPSec, and GPG.</li>
    <li>Where applicable, anonymize data collected during research to prevent the identification of individual subjects or sensitive characteristics. To anonymize data, you can remove or mask personally identifiable information (PII) such as names, addresses, and social security numbers. One common method is to use k-anonymity, which involves replacing values with a range of possible values that would still maintain anonymity. Other methods include differential privacy, which adds noise to the data, and homomorphic encryption, which allows for calculations to be performed on encrypted data without decryption.</li>
    <li>Implement robust data backup procedures to ensure data integrity and availability. Regularly test disaster recovery plans to ensure they are effective in the event of data loss or system failure.</li>
  </ul>

</details>

<h4 id="shutdown-protocols">Shutdown Protocols</h4>
