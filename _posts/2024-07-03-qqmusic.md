I installed an entertainment app on the Ubuntu 22.04 with 2K (2560*1440) screen, it crashed with these errors:
```rb
$ qqmusic
(electron) The default value of app.allowRendererProcessReuse is deprecated, it is currently "false".  It will change to be "true" in Electron 9.  For more information please check https://github.com/electron/electron/issues/18397

```

It will work normally by running: 
```
$ qqmusic --no-sandbox
```

So I added `--no-sandbox` in `qqmusic.desktop` under `/usr/share/applications`, if it is not system-wide applications, you need to navigate to user-specific applications path: `~/.local/share/applications/`

```
[Desktop Entry]                                                                                                                              
Name=qqmusic
Exec=/opt/qqmusic/qqmusic %U --no-sandbox
Terminal=false
Type=Application
Icon=qqmusic
StartupWMClass=qqmusic
Comment=Tencent QQMusic
Categories=AudioVideo;
```

And to make this changes take effect, I pressed `Alt + F2` for GNOME and entered `r` to reload the desktop environment, you could also try log out and log back in.
