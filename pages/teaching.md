### Teaching Philosophy: Learning by Doing
I believe students learn best through project-based and hands-on experiences, particularly in science and engineering, where applying theory to real-world problems promotes deeper understanding and skill development. This approach supports active engagement, critical thinking, and collaboration, while also helping students build confidence and adaptability. However, I also recognize that such education can be resource-intensive—it requires time, space for failure, experienced teaching, and often access to hardware or specialized tools. Despite these constraints, I try to incorporate this philosophy where possible, even in small-scale or simulated settings, to foster a mindset of exploration, reflection, and ownership in learning.
