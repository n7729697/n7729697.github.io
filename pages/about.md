I am a first year Ph.D. student in Division of Computer Systems at Uppsala University [Cyber-physical Systems Lab](https://www.it.uu.se/research/group/CPS-Lab) and supervised by Dr. [Didem Gürdür Broo](https://www.uu.se/en/contact-and-organisation/staff?query=N22-649) and Dr. [Ginevra Castellano](https://www.uu.se/en/contact-and-organisation/staff?query=N14-947). My research interests lie in robotics. My research focuses on multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) for heterogeneous multi-robot collaboration. I am particularly interested in developing methods that enable teams of robots with diverse capabilities to coordinate effectively in dynamic environments.
